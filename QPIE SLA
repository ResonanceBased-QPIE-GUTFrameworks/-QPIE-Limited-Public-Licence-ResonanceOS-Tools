# (((QPIE))) ResonanceOS via Coherence Public SLA

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Active (Free Tier Ready)  
**Maintainer:** Core (((qpie))) Development Team  
**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD  


## 1. Service Overview

(((qpie))) provides an open-access simulation and diagnostic utility that measures resonance stability, coherence behavior, and anomaly detection in quantum-inspired systems.  
This SLA applies to the **public free tier** as well as higher service tiers for research and enterprise users.

---

## 2. Scope

This SLA covers:
- API endpoints and simulation runners released through the official GitHub repository.
- Public free-tier access for baseline diagnostic runs.
- Premium SLA commitments for research and enterprise partners.

It does **not** cover:
- Unauthorized forks or modified versions.
- Third-party hosting not operated by the core development team.

---

## 3. Availability & Uptime

- **Free Tier:** 99.5% uptime target per calendar month.
- **Research Tier:** 99.7% uptime target with priority scheduling.
- **Enterprise Tier:** 99.9% uptime with dedicated failover clusters.

Scheduled maintenance notices will be posted at least **48 hours in advance**.

---

## 4. Performance Metrics

- **Baseline Throughput (Free):** Up to 10,000 runs/day per user.
- **Research SLA:** Up to 100,000 runs/day per user.
- **Enterprise SLA:** Custom scaling up to millions of runs/day.

**Latency Guarantees (simulator runs):**
- Free: <10 seconds average per job.
- Research: <5 seconds average per job.
- Enterprise: <2 seconds average per job (subject to backend constraints).

---

## 5. Reliability

Each run produces a JSON trace including:
- Parameter values.
- Fidelity and coherence metrics.
- Anomaly detection flags.

Free tier includes baseline GHZ vs experimental comparisons.  
Premium tiers include extended modules (ensemble stability, adversarial drift, multi-phase sweeps).

---

## 6. Support

- **Free Tier:** Community support (GitHub Issues, Discussions).
- **Research Tier:** Email support, 72h response target.
- **Enterprise Tier:** Dedicated account manager, 24h response target.


## 7. User Responsibilities

- Free tier use is restricted to educational, personal, and nonprofit research.  
- Commercial applications must enroll in Research or Enterprise SLA.  
- Users may not attempt to reverse-engineer hidden coefficients or proprietary modules.  


## 8. Monetization & Roadmap

While the public tier remains **free and open**, premium SLA options fund continued development and research.  
Revenue supports expansion into:  
- SaaS consulting,  
- Education partnerships,  
- Advanced hardware pilots.


## 9. Termination

Violation of SLA terms (e.g., misuse, reverse-engineering, breach of license) may result in suspension or termination of service.
